2. Run ``python setup.py install`` to install the Python client.

If you are planning to contribute:

1. Run ``pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`` to install development
   dependencies.
2. Use `black <https://pypi.org/project/black/>`__ to reformat the code
   by running the ``black --config black.toml .`` command.
3. Make sure that tests are passing by following the steps described
   in the :ref:`development_and_testing:testing` section.
