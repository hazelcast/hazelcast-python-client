Development and Testing
=======================

If you want to help with bug fixes, develop new features or tweak the
implementation to your applicationâ€™s needs, you can follow the steps in
this section.

Building and Using Client From Sources
--------------------------------------

Follow the below steps to build and install Hazelcast Python client from
its source:

1. Clone the GitHub repository
   (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-python-client.git).
2. Run ``python setup.py install`` to install the Python client.

If you are planning to contribute, please make sure that it fits the
guidelines described in
`PEP8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`__.

Testing
-------

In order to test Hazelcast Python client locally, you will need the
following:

- Java 8 or newer
- Maven

Following commands starts the tests according to your operating system:

.. code:: bash

    bash run-tests.sh

or

.. code:: powershell

    .\run-tests.ps1

Test script automatically downloads ``hazelcast-remote-controller`` and
Hazelcast IMDG. The script uses Maven to download those.
