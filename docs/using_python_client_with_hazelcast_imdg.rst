Using Python Client with Hazelcast IMDG
=======================================

This chapter provides information on how you can use Hazelcast IMDG’s
data structures in the Python client, after giving some basic
information including an overview to the client API, operation modes of
the client and how it handles the failures.

Python Client API Overview
--------------------------

Hazelcast Python client is designed to be fully asynchronous. See the
:ref:`getting_started:basic usage` section to learn more about
the asynchronous nature of the Python Client.

If you are ready to go, let’s start to use Hazelcast Python client.

The first step is configuration. See the
:ref:`configuration_overview:configuration overview` section for
details.

The following is an example on how to configure and initialize the
``HazelcastClient`` to connect to the cluster:

.. code:: python

    client = hazelcast.HazelcastClient(
        cluster_name="dev",
        cluster_members=[
            "198.51.100.2"
        ]
    )

This client object is your gateway to access all the Hazelcast
distributed objects.

Let’s create a map and populate it with some data, as shown below.

.. code:: python

    # Get a Map called 'my-distributed-map'
    customer_map = client.get_map("customers").blocking()

    # Write and read some data
    customer_map.put("1", "John Stiles")
    customer_map.put("2", "Richard Miles")
    customer_map.put("3", "Judy Doe")

As the final step, if you are done with your client, you can shut it
down as shown below. This will release all the used resources and close
connections to the cluster.

.. code:: python

    client.shutdown()

Python Client Operation Modes
-----------------------------

The client has two operation modes because of the distributed nature of
the data and cluster: smart and unisocket. Refer to the
:ref:`setting_up_client_network:setting smart routing`
section to see how to configure the client for different operation
modes.

Smart Client
~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the smart mode, the clients connect to each cluster member. Since
each data partition uses the well known and consistent hashing
algorithm, each client can send an operation to the relevant cluster
member, which increases the overall throughput and efficiency. Smart
mode is the default mode.

Unisocket Client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For some cases, the clients can be required to connect to a single
member instead of each member in the cluster. Firewalls, security or
some custom networking issues can be the reason for these cases.

In the unisocket client mode, the client will only connect to one of the
configured addresses. This single member will behave as a gateway to the
other members. For any operation requested from the client, it will
redirect the request to the relevant member and return the response back
to the client returned from this member.

Handling Failures
-----------------

There are two main failure cases you should be aware of. Below sections
explain these and the configurations you can perform to achieve proper
behavior.

Handling Client Connection Failure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While the client is trying to connect initially to one of the members in
the ``cluster_members``, all the members might not be available.
Instead of giving up, throwing an error and stopping the client, the
client retries to connect as configured. This behavior is described in
the
:ref:`client_connection_strategy:configuring client connection retry`
section.

The client executes each operation through the already established
connection to the cluster. If this connection(s) disconnects or drops,
the client will try to reconnect as configured.

Handling Retry-able Operation Failure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While sending the requests to the related members, the operations can
fail due to various reasons. Read-only operations are retried by
default. If you want to enable retrying for the other operations, you
can set the ``redo_operation`` to ``True``. See the
:ref:`setting_up_client_network:enabling redo operation` section.

You can set a timeout for retrying the operations sent to a member. This
can be tuned by passing the ``invocation_timeout`` argument to the
client. The client will retry an operation within this given period, of
course, if it is a read-only operation or you enabled the
``redo_operation`` as stated in the above. This timeout value is
important when there is a failure resulted by either of the following
causes:

- Member throws an exception.
- Connection between the client and member is closed.
- Client’s heartbeat requests are timed out.

When a connection problem occurs, an operation is retried if it is
certain that it has not run on the member yet or if it is idempotent
such as a read-only operation, i.e., retrying does not have a side
effect. If it is not certain whether the operation has run on the
member, then the non-idempotent operations are not retried. However, as
explained in the first paragraph of this section, you can force all the
client operations to be retried (``redo_operation``) when there is a
connection failure between the client and member. But in this case, you
should know that some operations may run multiple times causing
conflicts. For example, assume that your client sent a ``queue.offer``
operation to the member and then the connection is lost. Since there
will be no response for this operation, you will not know whether it has
run on the member or not. I f you enabled ``redo_operation``, it means
this operation may run again, which may cause two instances of the same
object in the queue.

When invocation is being retried, the client may wait some time before
it retries again. This duration can be configured using the
``invocation_retry_pause`` argument.

The default retry pause time is ``1`` second.

Using Distributed Data Structures
---------------------------------

Most of the distributed data structures are supported by the Python
client. In this chapter, you will learn how to use these distributed
data structures.

Using Map
~~~~~~~~~

Hazelcast Map is a distributed dictionary. Through the Python client,
you can perform operations like reading and writing from/to a Hazelcast
Map with the well known get and put methods. For details, see the `Map
section <https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/index.html#map>`__
in the Hazelcast IMDG Reference Manual.

A Map usage example is shown below.

.. code:: python

    # Get a Map called 'my-distributed-map'
    my_map = client.get_map("my-distributed-map").blocking()

    # Run Put and Get operations
    my_map.put("key", "value")
    my_map.get("key")

    # Run concurrent Map operations (optimistic updates)
    my_map.put_if_absent("somekey", "somevalue")
    my_map.replace_if_same("key", "value", "newvalue")

Using MultiMap
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hazelcast MultiMap is a distributed and specialized map where you can
store multiple values under a single key. For details, see the `MultiMap
section <https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/index.html#multimap>`__
in the Hazelcast IMDG Reference Manual.

A MultiMap usage example is shown below.

.. code:: python

    # Get a MultiMap called 'my-distributed-multimap'
    multi_map = client.get_multi_map("my-distributed-multimap").blocking()

    # Put values in the map against the same key
    multi_map.put("my-key", "value1")
    multi_map.put("my-key", "value2")
    multi_map.put("my-key", "value3")

    # Read and print out all the values for associated with key called 'my-key'
    # Outputs '['value2', 'value1', 'value3']'
    values = multi_map.get("my-key")
    print(values)

    # Remove specific key/value pair
    multi_map.remove("my-key", "value2")

Using Replicated Map
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hazelcast Replicated Map is a distributed key-value data structure where
the data is replicated to all members in the cluster. It provides full
replication of entries to all members for high speed access. For
details, see the `Replicated Map
section <https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/index.html#replicated-map>`__
in the Hazelcast IMDG Reference Manual.

A Replicated Map usage example is shown below.

.. code:: python

    # Get a ReplicatedMap called 'my-replicated-map'
    replicated_map = client.get_replicated_map("my-replicated-map").blocking()

    # Put and get a value from the Replicated Map
    # (key/value is replicated to all members)
    replaced_value = replicated_map.put("key", "value")

    # Will be None as its first update
    print("replaced value = {}".format(replaced_value)) # Outputs 'replaced value = None'

    # The value is retrieved from a random member in the cluster
    value = replicated_map.get("key")

    print("value for key = {}".format(value)) # Outputs 'value for key = value'

Using Queue
~~~~~~~~~~~

Hazelcast Queue is a distributed queue which enables all cluster members
to interact with it. For details, see the `Queue
section <https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/index.html#queue>`__
in the Hazelcast IMDG Reference Manual.

A Queue usage example is shown below.

.. code:: python

    # Get a Queue called 'my-distributed-queue'
    queue = client.get_queue("my-distributed-queue").blocking()

    # Offer a string into the Queue
    queue.offer("item")

    # Poll the Queue and return the string
    item = queue.poll()

    # Timed-restricted operations
    queue.offer("another-item", 0.5)  # waits up to 0.5 seconds
    another_item = queue.poll(5)  # waits up to 5 seconds

    # Indefinitely blocking Operations
    queue.put("yet-another-item")

    print(queue.take()) # Outputs 'yet-another-item'

Using Set
~~~~~~~~~

Hazelcast Set is a distributed set which does not allow duplicate
elements. For details, see the `Set
section <https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/index.html#set>`__
in the Hazelcast IMDG Reference Manual.

A Set usage example is shown below.

.. code:: python

    # Get a Set called 'my-distributed-set'
    my_set = client.get_set("my-distributed-set").blocking()

    # Add items to the Set with duplicates
    my_set.add("item1")
    my_set.add("item1")
    my_set.add("item2")
    my_set.add("item2")
    my_set.add("item2")
    my_set.add("item3")

    # Get the items. Note that there are no duplicates.
    for item in my_set.get_all():
        print(item)

Using List
~~~~~~~~~~

Hazelcast List is a distributed list which allows duplicate elements and
preserves the order of elements. For details, see the `List
section <https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/index.html#list>`__
in the Hazelcast IMDG Reference Manual.

A List usage example is shown below.

.. code:: python

    # Get a List called 'my-distributed-list'
    my_list = client.get_list("my-distributed-list").blocking()

    # Add element to the list
    my_list.add("item1")
    my_list.add("item2")

    # Remove the first element
    print("Removed:", my_list.remove_at(0))  # Outputs 'Removed: item1'

    # There is only one element left
    print("Current size is", my_list.size())  # Outputs 'Current size is 1'

    # Clear the list
    my_list.clear()

Using Ringbuffer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hazelcast Ringbuffer is a replicated but not partitioned data structure
that stores its data in a ring-like structure. You can think of it as a
circular array with a given capacity. Each Ringbuffer has a tail and a
head. The tail is where the items are added and the head is where the
items are overwritten or expired. You can reach each element in a
Ringbuffer using a sequence ID, which is mapped to the elements between
the head and tail (inclusive) of the Ringbuffer. For details, see the
`Ringbuffer
section <https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/index.html#ringbuffer>`__
in the Hazelcast IMDG Reference Manual.

A Ringbuffer usage example is shown below.

.. code:: python

    # Get a RingBuffer called "my-ringbuffer"
    ringbuffer = client.get_ringbuffer("my-ringbuffer").blocking()

    # Add two items into ring buffer
    ringbuffer.add(100)
    ringbuffer.add(200)

    # We start from the oldest item.
    # If you want to start from the next item, call ringbuffer.tail_sequence()+1
    sequence = ringbuffer.head_sequence()
    print(ringbuffer.read_one(sequence))  # Outputs '100'

    sequence += 1
    print(ringbuffer.read_one(sequence))  # Outputs '200'

Using Topic
~~~~~~~~~~~

Hazelcast Topic is a distribution mechanism for publishing messages that
are delivered to multiple subscribers. For details, see the `Topic
section <https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/index.html#topic>`__
in the Hazelcast IMDG Reference Manual.

A Topic usage example is shown below.

.. code:: python

    # Function to be called when a message is published
    def print_on_message(topic_message):
        print("Got message:", topic_message.message)

    # Get a Topic called "my-distributed-topic"
    topic = client.get_topic("my-distributed-topic").blocking()

    # Add a Listener to the Topic
    topic.add_listener(print_on_message)

    # Publish a message to the Topic
    topic.publish("Hello to distributed world") # Outputs 'Got message: Hello to distributed world'

Using Transactions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hazelcast Python client provides transactional operations like beginning
transactions, committing transactions and retrieving transactional data
structures like the ``TransactionalMap``, ``TransactionalSet``,
``TransactionalList``, ``TransactionalQueue`` and
``TransactionalMultiMap``.

You can create a ``Transaction`` object using the Python client to
begin, commit and rollback a transaction. You can obtain
transaction-aware instances of queues, maps, sets, lists and multimaps
via the ``Transaction`` object, work with them and commit or rollback in
one shot. For details, see the `Transactions
section <https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/index.html#transactions>`__
in the Hazelcast IMDG Reference Manual.

.. code:: python

    # Create a Transaction object and begin the transaction
    transaction = client.new_transaction(timeout=10)
    transaction.begin()

    # Get transactional distributed data structures
    txn_map = transaction.get_map("transactional-map")
    txn_queue = transaction.get_queue("transactional-queue")
    txt_set = transaction.get_set("transactional-set")
    try:
        obj = txn_queue.poll()

        # Process obj

        txn_map.put("1", "value1")
        txt_set.add("value")

        # Do other things

        # Commit the above changes done in the cluster.
        transaction.commit()
    except Exception as ex:
        # In the case of a transactional failure, rollback the transaction
        transaction.rollback()
        print("Transaction failed! {}".format(ex.args))

In a transaction, operations will not be executed immediately. Their
changes will be local to the ``Transaction`` object until committed.
However, they will ensure the changes via locks.

For the above example, when ``txn_map.put()`` is executed, no data will
be put in the map but the key will be locked against changes. While
committing, operations will be executed, the value will be put to the
map and the key will be unlocked.

The isolation level in Hazelcast Transactions is ``READ_COMMITTED`` on
the level of a single partition. If you are in a transaction, you can
read the data in your transaction and the data that is already
committed. If you are not in a transaction, you can only read the
committed data.

Using PN Counter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hazelcast ``PNCounter`` (Positive-Negative Counter) is a CRDT
positive-negative counter implementation. It is an eventually consistent
counter given there is no member failure. For details, see the `PN
Counter
section <https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/index.html#pn-counter>`__
in the Hazelcast IMDG Reference Manual.

A PN Counter usage example is shown below.

.. code:: python

    # Get a PN Counter called 'pn-counter'
    pn_counter = client.get_pn_counter("pn-counter").blocking()

    # Counter is initialized with 0
    print(pn_counter.get()) # 0

    # xx_and_get() variants does the operation
    # and returns the final value
    print(pn_counter.add_and_get(5))  # 5
    print(pn_counter.decrement_and_get())  # 4

    # get_and_xx() variants returns the current
    # value and then does the operation
    print(pn_counter.get_and_increment())  # 4
    print(pn_counter.get())  # 5

Using Flake ID Generator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hazelcast ``FlakeIdGenerator`` is used to generate cluster-wide unique
identifiers. Generated identifiers are long primitive values and are
k-ordered (roughly ordered). IDs are in the range from ``0`` to ``2^63-1``
(maximum signed long value). For details, see the `FlakeIdGenerator
section <https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/index.html#flakeidgenerator>`__
in the Hazelcast IMDG Reference Manual.

.. code:: python

    # Get a Flake ID Generator called 'flake-id-generator'
    generator = client.get_flake_id_generator("flake-id-generator").blocking()

    # Generate a some unique identifier
    print("ID:", generator.new_id())

Configuring Flake ID Generator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You may configure Flake ID Generators using the ``flake_id_generators``
argument:

.. code:: python

    client = hazelcast.HazelcastClient(
        flake_id_generators={
            "flake-id-generator": {
                "prefetch_count": 123,
                "prefetch_validity": 150
            }
        }
    )

The following are the descriptions of configuration elements and
attributes:

- keys of the dictionary: Name of the Flake ID Generator.
- ``prefetch_count``: Count of IDs which are pre-fetched on the
  background when one call to ``generator.newId()`` is made. Its value
  must be in the range ``1`` - ``100,000``. Its default value is
  ``100``.
- ``prefetch_validity``: Specifies for how long the pre-fetched IDs can
  be used. After this time elapses, a new batch of IDs are fetched.
  Time unit is seconds. Its default value is ``600`` seconds (``10``
  minutes). The IDs contain a timestamp component, which ensures a
  rough global ordering of them. If an ID is assigned to an object that
  was created later, it will be out of order. If ordering is not
  important, set this value to ``0``.

CP Subsystem
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hazelcast IMDG 4.0 introduces CP concurrency primitives with respect to
the `CAP
principle <http://awoc.wolski.fi/dlib/big-data/Brewer_podc_keynote_2000.pdf>`__,
i.e., they always maintain
`linearizability <https://aphyr.com/posts/313-strong-consistency-models>`__
and prefer consistency to availability during network partitions and
client or server failures.

All data structures within CP Subsystem are available through
``client.cp_subsystem`` component of the client.

Before using Atomic Long, Lock, and Semaphore, CP Subsystem has to be
enabled on cluster-side. Refer to `CP
Subsystem <https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/#cp-subsystem>`__
documentation for more information.

Data structures in CP Subsystem run in CP groups. Each CP group elects
its own Raft leader and runs the Raft consensus algorithm independently.
The CP data structures differ from the other Hazelcast data structures
in two aspects. First, an internal commit is performed on the METADATA
CP group every time you fetch a proxy from this interface. Hence,
callers should cache returned proxy objects. Second, if you call
``distributed_object.destroy()`` on a CP data structure proxy, that data
structure is terminated on the underlying CP group and cannot be
reinitialized until the CP group is force-destroyed. For this reason,
please make sure that you are completely done with a CP data structure
before destroying its proxy.

Using AtomicLong
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Hazelcast ``AtomicLong`` is the distributed implementation of atomic
64-bit integer counter. It offers various atomic operations such as
``get``, ``set``, ``get_and_set``, ``compare_and_set`` and
``increment_and_get``. This data structure is a part of CP Subsystem.

An Atomic Long usage example is shown below.

.. code:: python

    # Get an AtomicLong called "my-atomic-long"
    atomic_long = client.cp_subsystem.get_atomic_long("my-atomic-long").blocking()
    # Get current value
    value = atomic_long.get()
    print("Value:", value)
    # Prints:
    # Value: 0

    # Increment by 42
    atomic_long.add_and_get(42)
    # Set to 0 atomically if the current value is 42
    result = atomic_long.compare_and_set(42, 0)
    print ('CAS operation result:', result)
    # Prints:
    # CAS operation result: True

AtomicLong implementation does not offer exactly-once / effectively-once
execution semantics. It goes with at-least-once execution semantics by
default and can cause an API call to be committed multiple times in case
of CP member failures. It can be tuned to offer at-most-once execution
semantics. Please see
`fail-on-indeterminate-operation-state <https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/index.html#cp-subsystem-configuration>`__
server-side setting.

Using Lock
^^^^^^^^^^

Hazelcast ``FencedLock`` is the distributed and reentrant implementation
of a linearizable lock. It is CP with respect to the CAP principle. It
works on top of the Raft consensus algorithm. It offers linearizability
during crash-stop failures and network partitions. If a network
partition occurs, it remains available on at most one side of the
partition.

A basic Lock usage example is shown below.

.. code:: python

    # Get a FencedLock called "my-lock"
    lock = client.cp_subsystem.get_lock("my-lock").blocking()
    # Acquire the lock and get the fencing token
    fence = lock.lock()
    try:
        # Your guarded code goes here
        pass
    finally:
        # Make sure to release the lock
        lock.unlock()

FencedLock works on top of CP sessions. It keeps a CP session open while
the lock is acquired. Please refer to `CP
Session <https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/index.html#cp-sessions>`__
documentation for more information.

By default, FencedLock is reentrant. Once a caller acquires the lock, it
can acquire the lock reentrantly as many times as it wants in a
linearizable manner. You can configure the reentrancy behavior on the
member side. For instance, reentrancy can be disabled and FencedLock can
work as a non-reentrant mutex. You can also set a custom reentrancy
limit. When the reentrancy limit is already reached, FencedLock does not
block a lock call. Instead, it fails with
``LockAcquireLimitReachedError`` or a specified return value.

Distributed locks are unfortunately *not equivalent* to single-node
mutexes because of the complexities in distributed systems, such as
uncertain communication patterns, and independent and partial failures.
In an asynchronous network, no lock service can guarantee mutual
exclusion, because there is no way to distinguish between a slow and a
crashed process. Consider the following scenario, where a Hazelcast
client acquires a FencedLock, then hits a long pause. Since it will not
be able to commit session heartbeats while paused, its CP session will
be eventually closed. After this moment, another Hazelcast client can
acquire this lock. If the first client wakes up again, it may not
immediately notice that it has lost ownership of the lock. In this case,
multiple clients think they hold the lock. If they attempt to perform an
operation on a shared resource, they can break the system. To prevent
such situations, you can choose to use an infinite session timeout, but
this time probably you are going to deal with liveliness issues. For the
scenario above, even if the first client actually crashes, requests sent
by 2 clients can be re-ordered in the network and hit the external
resource in reverse order.

There is a simple solution for this problem. Lock holders are ordered by
a monotonic fencing token, which increments each time the lock is
assigned to a new owner. This fencing token can be passed to external
services or resources to ensure sequential execution of side effects
performed by lock holders.

The following diagram illustrates the idea. Client-1 acquires the lock
first and receives ``1`` as its fencing token. Then, it passes this
token to the external service, which is our shared resource in this
scenario. Just after that, Client-1 hits a long GC pause and eventually
loses ownership of the lock because it misses to commit CP session
heartbeats. Then, Client-2 chimes in and acquires the lock. Similar to
Client-1, Client-2 passes its fencing token to the external service.
After that, once Client-1 comes back alive, its write request will be
rejected by the external service, and only Client-2 will be able to
safely talk to it.

You can read more about the fencing token idea in Martin Kleppmann’s
“How to do distributed locking” blog post and Google’s Chubby paper.

Using Semaphore
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Hazelcast ``Semaphore`` is the distributed implementation of a
linearizable and distributed semaphore. It offers multiple operations
for acquiring the permits. This data structure is a part of CP
Subsystem.

Semaphore is a cluster-wide counting semaphore. Conceptually, it
maintains a set of permits. Each ``acquire()`` waits if necessary until
a permit is available, and then takes it. Dually, each ``release()``
adds a permit, potentially releasing a waiting acquirer. However, no
actual permit objects are used; the semaphore just keeps a count of the
number available and acts accordingly.

A basic Semaphore usage example is shown below.

.. code:: python

    # Get a Semaphore called "my-semaphore"
    semaphore = client.cp_subsystem.get_semaphore("my-semaphore").blocking()
    # Try to initialize the semaphore
    # (does nothing if the semaphore is already initialized)
    semaphore.init(3)
    # Acquire 3 permits out of 3
    semaphore.acquire(3)
    # Release 2 permits
    semaphore.release(2)
    # Check available permits
    available = semaphore.available_permits()
    print("Available:", available)
    # Prints:
    # Available: 2

Beware of the increased risk of indefinite postponement when using the
multiple-permit acquire. If permits are released one by one, a caller
waiting for one permit will acquire it before a caller waiting for
multiple permits regardless of the call order. Correct usage of a
semaphore is established by programming convention in the application.

As an alternative, potentially safer approach to the multiple-permit
acquire, you can use the ``try_acquire()`` method of Semaphore. It tries
to acquire the permits in optimistic manner and immediately returns with
a ``bool`` operation result. It also accepts an optional ``timeout``
argument which specifies the timeout in seconds to acquire the permits
before giving up.

.. code:: python

    # Try to acquire 2 permits
    success = semaphore.try_acquire(2)
    # Check for the result of the acquire request
    if success:
        try:
            pass
            # Your guarded code goes here
        finally:
            # Make sure to release the permits
            semaphore.release(2)

Semaphore data structure has two variations:

- The default implementation is session-aware. In this one, when a
  caller makes its very first ``acquire()`` call, it starts a new CP
  session with the underlying CP group. Then, liveliness of the caller
  is tracked via this CP session. When the caller fails, permits
  acquired by this caller are automatically and safely released.
  However, the session-aware version comes with a limitation, that is,
  a Hazelcast client cannot release permits before acquiring them
  first. In other words, a client can release only the permits it has
  acquired earlier.
- The second implementation is sessionless. This one does not perform
  auto-cleanup of acquired permits on failures. Acquired permits are
  not bound to callers and permits can be released without acquiring
  first. However, you need to handle failed permit owners on your own.
  If a Hazelcast server or a client fails while holding some permits,
  they will not be automatically released. You can use the sessionless
  CP Semaphore implementation by enabling JDK compatibility
  ``jdk-compatible`` server-side setting. Refer to `Semaphore
  configuration <https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/index.html#semaphore-configuration>`__
  documentation for more details.

Using CountDownLatch
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Hazelcast ``CountDownLatch`` is the distributed implementation of a
linearizable and distributed countdown latch. This data structure is a
cluster-wide synchronization aid that allows one or more callers to wait
until a set of operations being performed in other callers completes.
This data structure is a part of CP Subsystem.

A basic CountDownLatch usage example is shown below.

.. code:: python

    # Get a CountDownLatch called "my-latch"
    latch = client.cp_subsystem.get_count_down_latch("my-latch").blocking()
    # Try to initialize the latch
    # (does nothing if the count is not zero)
    initialized = latch.try_set_count(1)
    print("Initialized:", initialized)
    # Check count
    count = latch.get_count()
    print("Count:", count)
    # Prints:
    # Count: 1

    # Bring the count down to zero after 10ms
    def run():
        time.sleep(0.01)
        latch.count_down()

    t = Thread(target=run)
    t.start()

    # Wait up to 1 second for the count to become zero up
    count_is_zero = latch.await(1)
    print("Count is zero:", count_is_zero)


.. Note:: CountDownLatch count can be reset with ``try_set_count()``
    after a countdown has finished, but not during an active count.

Using AtomicReference
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Hazelcast ``AtomicReference`` is the distributed implementation of a
linearizable object reference. It provides a set of atomic operations
allowing to modify the value behind the reference. This data structure
is a part of CP Subsystem.

A basic AtomicReference usage example is shown below.

.. code:: python

    # Get a AtomicReference called "my-ref"
    my_ref = client.cp_subsystem.get_atomic_reference("my-ref").blocking()
    # Set the value atomically
    my_ref.set(42)
    # Read the value
    value = my_ref.get()
    print("Value:", value)
    # Prints:
    # Value: 42

    # Try to replace the value with "value"
    # with a compare-and-set atomic operation
    result = my_ref.compare_and_set(42, "value")
    print("CAS result:", result)
    # Prints:
    # CAS result: True

The following are some considerations you need to know when you use
AtomicReference:

- AtomicReference works based on the byte-content and not on the
  object-reference. If you use the ``compare_and_set()`` method, do not
  change to the original value because its serialized content will then
  be different.
- All methods returning an object return a private copy. You can modify
  the private copy, but the rest of the world is shielded from your
  changes. If you want these changes to be visible to the rest of the
  world, you need to write the change back to the AtomicReference; but
  be careful about introducing a data-race.
- The in-memory format of an AtomicReference is ``binary``. The
  receiving side does not need to have the class definition available
  unless it needs to be deserialized on the other side, e.g., because
  a method like ``alter()`` is executed. This deserialization is done
  for every call that needs to have the object instead of the binary
  content, so be careful with expensive object graphs that need to be
  deserialized.
- If you have an object with many fields or an object graph and you
  only need to calculate some information or need a subset of fields,
  you can use the ``apply()`` method. With the ``apply()`` method, the
  whole object does not need to be sent over the line; only the
  information that is relevant is sent.

AtomicReference does not offer exactly-once / effectively-once execution
semantics. It goes with at-least-once execution semantics by default and
can cause an API call to be committed multiple times in case of CP
member failures. It can be tuned to offer at-most-once execution
semantics. Please see
`fail-on-indeterminate-operation-state <https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/index.html#cp-subsystem-configuration>`__
server-side setting.

Distributed Events
------------------

This chapter explains when various events are fired and describes how
you can add event listeners on a Hazelcast Python client. These events
can be categorized as cluster and distributed data structure events.

Cluster Events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can add event listeners to a Hazelcast Python client. You can
configure the following listeners to listen to the events on the client
side:

- Membership Listener: Notifies when a member joins to/leaves the
  cluster.

- Lifecycle Listener: Notifies when the client is starting, started,
  connected, disconnected, shutting down and shutdown.

Listening for Member Events
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can add the following types of member events to the
``ClusterService``.

- ``member_added``: A new member is added to the cluster.
- ``member_removed``: An existing member leaves the cluster.

The ``ClusterService`` class exposes an ``add_listener()`` method that
allows one or more functions to be attached to the member events emitted
by the class.

The following is a membership listener registration by using the
``add_listener()`` method.

.. code:: python

    def added_listener(member):
        print("Member Added: The address is", member.address)


    def removed_listener(member):
        print("Member Removed. The address is", member.address)


    client.cluster_service.add_listener(
        member_added=added_listener,
        member_removed=removed_listener,
        fire_for_existing=True
    )

Also, you can set the ``fire_for_existing`` flag to ``True`` to receive
the events for list of available members when the listener is
registered.

Membership listeners can also be added during the client startup using
the ``membership_listeners`` argument.

.. code:: python

    client = hazelcast.HazelcastClient(
        membership_listeners=[
            (added_listener, removed_listener)
        ]
    )

Listening for Distributed Object Events
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The events for distributed objects are invoked when they are created and
destroyed in the cluster. When an event is received, listener function
will be called. The parameter passed into the listener function will be
of the type ``DistributedObjectEvent``. A ``DistributedObjectEvent``
contains the following fields:

- ``name``: Name of the distributed object.
- ``service_name``: Service name of the distributed object.
- ``event_type``: Type of the invoked event. It is either ``CREATED``
  or ``DESTROYED``.

The following is example of adding a distributed object listener to a
client.

.. code:: python

    def distributed_object_listener(event):
        print("Distributed object event >>>", event.name, event.service_name, event.event_type)


    client.add_distributed_object_listener(
        listener_func=distributed_object_listener
    ).result()

    map_name = "test_map"

    # This call causes a CREATED event
    test_map = client.get_map(map_name).blocking()

    # This causes no event because map was already created
    test_map2 = client.get_map(map_name).blocking()

    # This causes a DESTROYED event
    test_map.destroy()

**Output**

::

    Distributed object event >>> test_map hz:impl:mapService CREATED
    Distributed object event >>> test_map hz:impl:mapService DESTROYED

Listening for Lifecycle Events
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The lifecycle listener is notified for the following events:

- ``STARTING``: The client is starting.
- ``STARTED``: The client has started.
- ``CONNECTED``: The client connected to a member.
- ``SHUTTING_DOWN``: The client is shutting down.
- ``DISCONNECTED``: The client disconnected from a member.
- ``SHUTDOWN``: The client has shutdown.

The following is an example of the lifecycle listener that is added to
client during startup and its output.

.. code:: python

    def lifecycle_listener(state):
        print("Lifecycle Event >>>", state)


    client = hazelcast.HazelcastClient(
        lifecycle_listeners=[
            lifecycle_listener
        ]
    )

**Output:**

::

    INFO:hazelcast.lifecycle:HazelcastClient 4.0.0 is STARTING
    Lifecycle Event >>> STARTING
    INFO:hazelcast.lifecycle:HazelcastClient 4.0.0 is STARTED
    Lifecycle Event >>> STARTED
    INFO:hazelcast.connection:Trying to connect to Address(host=127.0.0.1, port=5701)
    INFO:hazelcast.lifecycle:HazelcastClient 4.0.0 is CONNECTED
    Lifecycle Event >>> CONNECTED
    INFO:hazelcast.connection:Authenticated with server Address(host=172.17.0.2, port=5701):7682c357-3bec-4841-b330-6f9ae0c08253, server version: 4.0, local address: Address(host=127.0.0.1, port=56732)
    INFO:hazelcast.cluster:

    Members [1] {
        Member [172.17.0.2]:5701 - 7682c357-3bec-4841-b330-6f9ae0c08253
    }

    INFO:hazelcast.client:Client started
    INFO:hazelcast.lifecycle:HazelcastClient 4.0.0 is SHUTTING_DOWN
    Lifecycle Event >>> SHUTTING_DOWN
    INFO:hazelcast.connection:Removed connection to Address(host=127.0.0.1, port=5701):7682c357-3bec-4841-b330-6f9ae0c08253, connection: Connection(id=0, live=False, remote_address=Address(host=172.17.0.2, port=5701))
    INFO:hazelcast.lifecycle:HazelcastClient 4.0.0 is DISCONNECTED
    Lifecycle Event >>> DISCONNECTED
    INFO:hazelcast.lifecycle:HazelcastClient 4.0.0 is SHUTDOWN
    Lifecycle Event >>> SHUTDOWN

You can also add lifecycle listeners after client initialization using
the ``LifecycleService``.

.. code:: python

    client.lifecycle_service.add_listener(lifecycle_listener)

Distributed Data Structure Events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can add event listeners to the distributed data structures.

Listening for Map Events
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can listen to map-wide or entry-based events by attaching functions
to the ``Map`` objects using the ``add_entry_listener()`` method. You
can listen the following events.

- ``added_func`` : Function to be called when an entry is added to map.
- ``removed_func`` : Function to be called when an entry is removed
  from map.
- ``updated_func`` : Function to be called when an entry is updated.
- ``evicted_func`` : Function to be called when an entry is evicted
  from map.
- ``evict_all_func`` : Function to be called when entries are evicted
  from map.
- ``clear_all_func`` : Function to be called when entries are cleared
  from map.
- ``merged_func`` : Function to be called when WAN replicated entry is
  merged.
- ``expired_func`` : Function to be called when an entry’s live time is
  expired.

You can also filter the events using ``key`` or ``predicate``. There is
also an option called ``include_value``. When this option is set to
true, event will also include the value.

An entry-based event is fired after the operations that affect a
specific entry. For example, ``map.put()``, ``map.remove()`` or
``map.evict()``. An ``EntryEvent`` object is passed to the listener
function.

See the following example.

.. code:: python

    def added(event):
        print("Entry Added: %s-%s" % (event.key, event.value))


    customer_map.add_entry_listener(include_value=True, added_func=added)
    customer_map.put("4", "Jane Doe")

A map-wide event is fired as a result of a map-wide operation. For
example, ``map.clear()`` or ``map.evict_all()``. An ``EntryEvent``
object is passed to the listener function.

See the following example.

.. code:: python

    def cleared(event):
        print("Map Cleared:", event.number_of_affected_entries)


    customer_map.add_entry_listener(include_value=True, clear_all_func=cleared)
    customer_map.clear()

Distributed Computing
---------------------

This chapter explains how you can use Hazelcast IMDG’s entry processor
implementation in the Python client.

Using EntryProcessor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hazelcast supports entry processing. An entry processor is a function
that executes your code on a map entry in an atomic way.

An entry processor is a good option if you perform bulk processing on a
``Map``. Usually you perform a loop of keys – executing
``Map.get(key)``, mutating the value, and finally putting the entry back
in the map using ``Map.put(key,value)``. If you perform this process
from a client or from a member where the keys do not exist, you
effectively perform two network hops for each update: the first to
retrieve the data and the second to update the mutated value.

If you are doing the process described above, you should consider using
entry processors. An entry processor executes a read and updates upon
the member where the data resides. This eliminates the costly network
hops described above.

.. Note:: Entry processor is meant to process a single entry per call.
    Processing multiple entries and data structures in an entry processor
    is not supported as it may result in deadlocks on the server side.

Hazelcast sends the entry processor to each cluster member and these
members apply it to the map entries. Therefore, if you add more members,
your processing completes faster.

Processing Entries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``Map`` class provides the following methods for entry processing:

- ``execute_on_key`` processes an entry mapped by a key.
- ``execute_on_keys`` processes entries mapped by a list of keys.
- ``execute_on_entries`` can process all entries in a map with a
  defined predicate. Predicate is optional.

In the Python client, an ``EntryProcessor`` should be
``IdentifiedDataSerializable`` or ``Portable`` because the server should
be able to deserialize it to process.

The following is an example for ``EntryProcessor`` which is an
``IdentifiedDataSerializable``.

.. code:: python

    from hazelcast.serialization.api import IdentifiedDataSerializable

    class IdentifiedEntryProcessor(IdentifiedDataSerializable):
        def __init__(self, value=None):
            self.value = value

        def read_data(self, object_data_input):
            self.value = object_data_input.read_string()

        def write_data(self, object_data_output):
            object_data_output.write_string(self.value)

        def get_factory_id(self):
            return 5

        def get_class_id(self):
            return 1

Now, you need to make sure that the Hazelcast member recognizes the
entry processor. For this, you need to implement the Java equivalent of
your entry processor and its factory, and create your own compiled class
or JAR files. For adding your own compiled class or JAR files to the
server’s ``CLASSPATH``, see the
:ref:`getting_started:adding user library to classpath` section.

The following is the Java equivalent of the entry processor in Python
client given above:

.. code:: java

    import com.hazelcast.map.EntryProcessor;
    import com.hazelcast.nio.ObjectDataInput;
    import com.hazelcast.nio.ObjectDataOutput;
    import com.hazelcast.nio.serialization.IdentifiedDataSerializable;

    import java.io.IOException;
    import java.util.Map;


    public class IdentifiedEntryProcessor
            implements EntryProcessor<String, String, String>, IdentifiedDataSerializable {

        static final int CLASS_ID = 1;
        private String value;

        public IdentifiedEntryProcessor() {
        }

        @Override
        public int getFactoryId() {
            return IdentifiedFactory.FACTORY_ID;
        }

        @Override
        public int getClassId() {
            return CLASS_ID;
        }

        @Override
        public void writeData(ObjectDataOutput out) throws IOException {
            out.writeUTF(value);
        }

        @Override
        public void readData(ObjectDataInput in) throws IOException {
            value = in.readUTF();
        }

        @Override
        public String process(Map.Entry<String, String> entry) {
            entry.setValue(value);
            return value;
        }
    }

You can implement the above processor’s factory as follows:

.. code:: java

    import com.hazelcast.nio.serialization.DataSerializableFactory;
    import com.hazelcast.nio.serialization.IdentifiedDataSerializable;

    public class IdentifiedFactory implements DataSerializableFactory {
        public static final int FACTORY_ID = 5;

        @Override
        public IdentifiedDataSerializable create(int typeId) {
            if (typeId == IdentifiedEntryProcessor.CLASS_ID) {
                return new IdentifiedEntryProcessor();
            }
            return null;
        }
    }

Now you need to configure the ``hazelcast.xml`` to add your factory as
shown below.

.. code:: xml

    <hazelcast>
        <serialization>
            <data-serializable-factories>
                <data-serializable-factory factory-id="5">
                    IdentifiedFactory
                </data-serializable-factory>
            </data-serializable-factories>
        </serialization>
    </hazelcast>

The code that runs on the entries is implemented in Java on the server
side. The client side entry processor is used to specify which entry
processor should be called. For more details about the Java
implementation of the entry processor, see the `Entry Processor
section <https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/index.html#entry-processor>`__
in the Hazelcast IMDG Reference Manual.

After the above implementations and configuration are done and you start
the server where your library is added to its ``CLASSPATH``, you can use
the entry processor in the ``Map`` methods. See the following example.

.. code:: python

    distributed_map = client.get_map("my-distributed-map").blocking()

    distributed_map.put("key", "not-processed")
    distributed_map.execute_on_key("key", IdentifiedEntryProcessor("processed"))

    print(distributed_map.get("key"))  # Outputs 'processed'

Distributed Query
-----------------

Hazelcast partitions your data and spreads it across cluster of members.
You can iterate over the map entries and look for certain entries
(specified by predicates) you are interested in. However, this is not
very efficient because you will have to bring the entire entry set and
iterate locally. Instead, Hazelcast allows you to run distributed
queries on your distributed map.

How Distributed Query Works
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. The requested predicate is sent to each member in the cluster.
2. Each member looks at its own local entries and filters them according
   to the predicate. At this stage, key-value pairs of the entries are
   deserialized and then passed to the predicate.
3. The predicate requester merges all the results coming from each
   member into a single set.

Distributed query is highly scalable. If you add new members to the
cluster, the partition count for each member is reduced and thus the
time spent by each member on iterating its entries is reduced. In
addition, the pool of partition threads evaluates the entries
concurrently in each member, and the network traffic is also reduced
since only filtered data is sent to the requester.

**Predicate Module Operators**

The ``predicate`` module offered by the Python client includes many
operators for your query requirements. Some of them are explained below.

- ``equal``: Checks if the result of an expression is equal to a
  given value.
- ``not_equal``: Checks if the result of an expression is not
  equal to a given value.
- ``instance_of``: Checks if the result of an expression has a
  certain type.
- ``like``: Checks if the result of an expression matches some
  string pattern. ``%`` (percentage sign) is the placeholder for many
  characters, ``_`` (underscore) is placeholder for only one character.
- ``ilike``: Checks if the result of an expression matches some
  string pattern in a case-insensitive manner.
- ``greater``: Checks if the result of an expression is greater
  than a certain value.
- ``greater_or_equal``: Checks if the result of an
  expression is greater than or equal to a certain value.
- ``less``: Checks if the result of an expression is less than
  a certain value.
- ``less_or_equal``: Checks if the result of an expression
  is less than or equal to a certain value.
- ``between``: Checks if the result of an expression is between two
  values (this is inclusive).
- ``in_``: Checks if the result of an expression is an element of a
  certain list.
- ``not_``: Checks if the result of an expression is false.
- ``regex``: Checks if the result of an expression matches some
  regular expression.
- ``true``: Creates an always true predicate that will pass all items.
- ``false``: Creates an always false predicate that will filter out all
  items.

Hazelcast offers the following ways for distributed query purposes:

- Combining Predicates with AND, OR, NOT

- Distributed SQL Query

Employee Map Query Example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Assume that you have an ``employee`` map containing the instances of
``Employee`` class, as coded below.

.. code:: python

    from hazelcast.serialization.api import Portable

    class Employee(Portable):
        def __init__(self, name=None, age=None, active=None, salary=None):
            self.name = name
            self.age = age
            self.active = active
            self.salary = salary

        def get_class_id(self):
            return 100

        def get_factory_id(self):
            return 1000

        def read_portable(self, reader):
            self.name = reader.read_string("name")
            self.age = reader.read_int("age")
            self.active = reader.read_boolean("active")
            self.salary = reader.read_double("salary")

        def write_portable(self, writer):
            writer.write_string("name", self.name)
            writer.write_int("age", self.age)
            writer.write_boolean("active", self.active)
            writer.write_double("salary", self.salary)

Note that ``Employee`` extends ``Portable``. As portable types are not
deserialized on the server side for querying, you don’t need to
implement its Java equivalent on the server side.

For types that are not portable, you need to implement its Java
equivalent and its data serializable factory on the server side for
server to reconstitute the objects from binary formats. In this case,
you need to compile the ``Employee`` and related factory classes with
server’s ``CLASSPATH`` and add them to the ``user-lib`` directory in the
extracted ``hazelcast-<version>.zip`` (or ``tar``) before starting the
server. See the :ref:`getting_started:adding user library to classpath`
section.

.. Note:: Querying with ``Portable`` class is faster as compared to
    ``IdentifiedDataSerializable``.

Querying by Combining Predicates with AND, OR, NOT
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can combine predicates by using the ``and_``, ``or_`` and ``not_``
operators, as shown in the below example.

.. code:: python

    from hazelcast.predicate import and_, equal, less

    employee_map = client.get_map("employee")

    predicate = and_(equal('active', True), less('age', 30))

    employees = employee_map.values(predicate).result()

In the above example code, ``predicate`` verifies whether the entry is
active and its ``age`` value is less than 30. This ``predicate`` is
applied to the ``employee`` map using the ``Map.values`` method. This
method sends the predicate to all cluster members and merges the results
coming from them.

.. Note:: Predicates can also be applied to ``key_set`` and
    ``entry_set`` of the Hazelcast IMDG’s distributed map.

Querying with SQL
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``SqlPredicate`` takes the regular SQL ``where`` clause. See the
following example:

.. code:: python

    from hazelcast.predicate import sql

    employee_map = client.get_map("employee")

    employees = employee_map.values(sql("active AND age < 30")).result()

Supported SQL Syntax
''''''''''''''''''''

**AND/OR:** ``<expression> AND <expression> AND <expression>…``

- ``active AND age > 30``
- ``active = false OR age = 45 OR name = 'Joe'``
- ``active AND ( age > 20 OR salary < 60000 )``

**Equality:** ``=, !=, <, ⇐, >, >=``

- ``<expression> = value``
- ``age <= 30``
- ``name = 'Joe'``
- ``salary != 50000``

**BETWEEN:** ``<attribute> [NOT] BETWEEN <value1> AND <value2>``

- ``age BETWEEN 20 AND 33 ( same as age >= 20 AND age ⇐ 33 )``
- ``age NOT BETWEEN 30 AND 40 ( same as age < 30 OR age > 40 )``

**IN:** ``<attribute> [NOT] IN (val1, val2,…)``

- ``age IN ( 20, 30, 40 )``
- ``age NOT IN ( 60, 70 )``
- ``active AND ( salary >= 50000 OR ( age NOT BETWEEN 20 AND 30 ) )``
- ``age IN ( 20, 30, 40 ) AND salary BETWEEN ( 50000, 80000 )``

**LIKE:** ``<attribute> [NOT] LIKE 'expression'``

The ``%`` (percentage sign) is the placeholder for multiple characters,
an ``_`` (underscore) is the placeholder for only one character.

- ``name LIKE 'Jo%'`` (true for ‘Joe’, ‘Josh’, ‘Joseph’ etc.)
- ``name LIKE 'Jo_'`` (true for ‘Joe’; false for ‘Josh’)
- ``name NOT LIKE 'Jo_'`` (true for ‘Josh’; false for ‘Joe’)
- ``name LIKE 'J_s%'`` (true for ‘Josh’, ‘Joseph’; false ‘John’, ‘Joe’)

**ILIKE:** ``<attribute> [NOT] ILIKE 'expression'``

ILIKE is similar to the LIKE predicate but in a case-insensitive manner.

- ``name ILIKE 'Jo%'`` (true for ‘Joe’, ‘joe’, ‘jOe’,‘Josh’,‘joSH’,
  etc.)
- ``name ILIKE 'Jo_'`` (true for ‘Joe’ or ‘jOE’; false for ‘Josh’)

**REGEX:** ``<attribute> [NOT] REGEX 'expression'``

- ``name REGEX 'abc-.*'`` (true for ‘abc-123’; false for ‘abx-123’)

Querying Examples with Predicates
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

You can use the ``__key`` attribute to perform a predicated search for
the entry keys. See the following example:

.. code:: python

    from hazelcast.predicate import sql

    person_map = client.get_map("persons").blocking()

    person_map.put("John", 28)
    person_map.put("Mary", 23)
    person_map.put("Judy", 30)

    predicate = sql("__key like M%")

    persons = person_map.values(predicate)

    print(persons[0]) # Outputs '23'

In this example, the code creates a list with the values whose keys
start with the letter “M”.

You can use the ``this`` attribute to perform a predicated search for
the entry values. See the following example:

.. code:: python

    from hazelcast.predicate import greater_or_equal

    person_map = client.get_map("persons").blocking()

    person_map.put("John", 28)
    person_map.put("Mary", 23)
    person_map.put("Judy", 30)

    predicate = greater_or_equal("this", 27)

    persons = person_map.values(predicate)

    print(persons[0], persons[1]) # Outputs '28 30'

In this example, the code creates a list with the values greater than or
equal to “27”.

Querying with JSON Strings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can query JSON strings stored inside your Hazelcast clusters. To
query the JSON string, you first need to create a ``HazelcastJsonValue``
from the JSON string or JSON serializable object. You can use
``HazelcastJsonValue``\ s both as keys and values in the distributed
data structures. Then, it is possible to query these objects using the
Hazelcast query methods explained in this section.

.. code:: python

    person1 = "{ \"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 35 }"
    person2 = "{ \"name\": \"Jane\", \"age\": 24 }"
    person3 = {"name": "Trey", "age": 17}

    id_person_map = client.get_map("json-values").blocking()

    # From JSON string
    id_person_map.put(1, HazelcastJsonValue(person1))
    id_person_map.put(2, HazelcastJsonValue(person2))

    # From JSON serializable object
    id_person_map.put(3, HazelcastJsonValue(person3))

    people_under_21 = id_person_map.values(less("age", 21))

When running the queries, Hazelcast treats values extracted from the
JSON documents as Java types so they can be compared with the query
attribute. JSON specification defines five primitive types to be used in
the JSON documents: ``number``,\ ``string``, ``true``, ``false`` and
``null``. The ``string``, ``true/false`` and ``null`` types are treated
as ``String``, ``boolean`` and ``null``, respectively. We treat the
extracted ``number`` values as ``long``\ s if they can be represented by
a ``long``. Otherwise, ``number``\ s are treated as ``double``\ s.

It is possible to query nested attributes and arrays in the JSON
documents. The query syntax is the same as querying other Hazelcast
objects using the ``Predicate``\ s.

.. code:: python

    # Sample JSON object
    # {
    #     "departmentId": 1,
    #     "room": "alpha",
    #     "people": [
    #         {
    #             "name": "Peter",
    #             "age": 26,
    #             "salary": 50000
    #         },
    #         {
    #             "name": "Jonah",
    #             "age": 50,
    #             "salary": 140000
    #         }
    #     ]
    # }
    # The following query finds all the departments that have a person named "Peter" working in them.

    department_with_peter = departments.values(equal("people[any].name", "Peter"))

``HazelcastJsonValue`` is a lightweight wrapper around your JSON
strings. It is used merely as a way to indicate that the contained
string should be treated as a valid JSON value. Hazelcast does not check
the validity of JSON strings put into to the maps. Putting an invalid
JSON string into a map is permissible. However, in that case whether
such an entry is going to be returned or not from a query is not
defined.

Metadata Creation for JSON Querying
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Hazelcast stores a metadata object per JSON serialized object stored.
This metadata object is created every time a JSON serialized object is
put into an ``Map``. Metadata is later used to speed up the query
operations. Metadata creation is on by default. Depending on your
application’s needs, you may want to turn off the metadata creation to
decrease the put latency and increase the throughput.

You can configure this using ``metadata-policy`` element for the map
configuration on the member side as follows:

.. code:: xml

    <hazelcast>
        ...
        <map name="map-a">
            <!--
            valid values for metadata-policy are:
              - OFF
              - CREATE_ON_UPDATE (default)
            -->
            <metadata-policy>OFF</metadata-policy>
        </map>
        ...
    </hazelcast>

Filtering with Paging Predicates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Hazelcast Python client provides paging for defined predicates. With its
``PagingPredicate``, you can get a collection of keys, values, or
entries page by page by filtering them with predicates and giving the
size of the pages. Also, you can sort the entries by specifying
comparators. In this case, the comparator should be either ``Portable``
or ``IdentifiedDataSerializable`` and the serialization factory
implementations should be registered on the member side. Please note
that, paging is done on the cluster members. Hence, client only sends a
marker comparator to indicate members which comparator to use. The
comparision logic must be defined on the member side by implementing the
``java.util.Comparator<Map.Entry>`` interface.

Paging predicates require the objects to be deserialized on the member
side from which the collection is retrieved. Therefore, you need to
register the serialization factories you use on all the members on which
the paging predicates are used. See the
:ref:`getting_started:adding user library to classpath` section for
more details.

In the example code below:

- The ``greater_or_equal`` predicate gets values from the
  ``students`` map. This predicate has a filter to retrieve the objects
  with an ``age`` greater than or equal to ``18``.

- Then a ``PagingPredicate`` is constructed in which the page size is
  ``5``, so that there are five objects in each page. The first time
  the ``values()`` method is called, the first page is fetched.

- Finally, the subsequent page is fetched by calling the ``next_page()``
  method of ``PagingPredicate`` and querying the map again with the
  updated ``PagingPredicate``.

.. code:: python

    from hazelcast.predicate import paging, greater_or_equal

    ...

    m = client.get_map("students").blocking()
    predicate = paging(greater_or_equal("age", 18), 5)

    # Retrieve the first page
    values = m.values(predicate)

    ...

    # Set up next page
    predicate.next_page()

    # Retrieve next page
    values = m.values(predicate)

If a comparator is not specified for ``PagingPredicate``, but you want
to get a collection of keys or values page by page, keys or values must
implement the ``java.lang.Comparable`` interface on the member side.
Otherwise, paging fails with an exception from the server. Luckily, a lot
of types implement the ``Comparable`` interface by
`default <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Comparable.html>`__,
including the primitive types, so, you may use values of types ``int``,
``float``, ``str`` etc. in paging without specifying a comparator on the
Python client.

You can also access a specific page more easily by setting the
``predicate.page`` attribute before making the remote call. This way, if
you make a query for the hundredth page, for example, it gets all
``100`` pages at once instead of reaching the hundredth page one by one
using the ``next_page()`` method.

.. Note:: ``PagingPredicate``, also known as Order & Limit, is not supported in
    Transactional Context.

Performance
-----------

Near Cache
~~~~~~~~~~

Map entries in Hazelcast are partitioned across the cluster members.
Hazelcast clients do not have local data at all. Suppose you read the
key ``k`` a number of times from a Hazelcast client and ``k`` is owned
by a member in your cluster. Then each ``map.get(k)`` will be a remote
operation, which creates a lot of network trips. If you have a map that
is mostly read, then you should consider creating a local Near Cache, so
that reads are sped up and less network traffic is created.

These benefits do not come for free, please consider the following
trade-offs:

- Clients with a Near Cache will have to hold the extra cached data,
  which increases memory consumption.
- If invalidation is enabled and entries are updated frequently, then
  invalidations will be costly.
- Near Cache breaks the strong consistency guarantees; you might be
  reading stale data.

Near Cache is highly recommended for maps that are mostly read.

Configuring Near Cache
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following snippet show how a Near Cache is configured in the Python
client using the ``near_caches`` argument, presenting all available
values for each element. When an element is missing from the
configuration, its default value is used.

.. code:: python

    from hazelcast.config import InMemoryFormat, EvictionPolicy

    client = hazelcast.HazelcastClient(
        near_caches={
            "mostly-read-map": {
                "invalidate_on_change": True,
                "time_to_live": 60,
                "max_idle": 30,
                # You can also set these to "OBJECT"
                # and "LRU" without importing anything.
                "in_memory_format": InMemoryFormat.OBJECT,
                "eviction_policy": EvictionPolicy.LRU,
                "eviction_max_size": 100,
                "eviction_sampling_count": 8,
                "eviction_sampling_pool_size": 16
            }
        }
    )

Following are the descriptions of all configuration elements:

- ``in_memory_format``: Specifies in which format data will be stored
  in your Near Cache. Note that a map’s in-memory format can be
  different from that of its Near Cache. Available values are as
  follows:

  - ``BINARY``: Data will be stored in serialized binary format
    (default value).
  - ``OBJECT``: Data will be stored in deserialized format.

- ``invalidate_on_change``: Specifies whether the cached entries are
  evicted when the entries are updated or removed. Its default value is
  ``True``.
- ``time_to_live``: Maximum number of seconds for each entry to stay in
  the Near Cache. Entries that are older than this period are
  automatically evicted from the Near Cache. Regardless of the eviction
  policy used, ``time_to_live_seconds`` still applies. Any non-negative
  number can be assigned. Its default value is ``None``. ``None`` means
  infinite.
- ``max_idle``: Maximum number of seconds each entry can stay in the
  Near Cache as untouched (not read). Entries that are not read more
  than this period are removed from the Near Cache. Any non-negative
  number can be assigned. Its default value is ``None``. ``None`` means
  infinite.
- ``eviction_policy``: Eviction policy configuration. Available values
  are as follows:

  - ``LRU``: Least Recently Used (default value).
  - ``LFU``: Least Frequently Used.
  - ``NONE``: No items are evicted and the ``eviction_max_size``
    property is ignored. You still can combine it with
    ``time_to_live`` and ``max_idle`` to evict items from the Near
    Cache.
  - ``RANDOM``: A random item is evicted.

- ``eviction_max_size``: Maximum number of entries kept in the memory
  before eviction kicks in.
- ``eviction_sampling_count``: Number of random entries that are
  evaluated to see if some of them are already expired. If there are
  expired entries, those are removed and there is no need for eviction.
- ``eviction_sampling_pool_size``: Size of the pool for eviction
  candidates. The pool is kept sorted according to eviction policy. The
  entry with the highest score is evicted.

Near Cache Example for Map
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following is an example configuration for a Near Cache defined in
the ``mostly-read-map`` map. According to this configuration, the
entries are stored as ``OBJECT``\ ’s in this Near Cache and eviction
starts when the count of entries reaches ``5000``; entries are evicted
based on the ``LRU`` (Least Recently Used) policy. In addition, when an
entry is updated or removed on the member side, it is eventually evicted
on the client side.

.. code:: python

    client = hazelcast.HazelcastClient(
        near_caches={
            "mostly-read-map": {
                "invalidate_on_change": True,
                "in_memory_format": InMemoryFormat.OBJECT,
                "eviction_policy": EvictionPolicy.LRU,
                "eviction_max_size": 5000,
            }
        }
    )

Near Cache Eviction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the scope of Near Cache, eviction means evicting (clearing) the
entries selected according to the given ``eviction_policy`` when the
specified ``eviction_max_size`` has been reached.

The ``eviction_max_size`` defines the entry count when the Near Cache is
full and determines whether the eviction should be triggered.

Once the eviction is triggered, the configured ``eviction_policy``
determines which, if any, entries must be evicted.

Near Cache Expiration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Expiration means the eviction of expired records. A record is expired:

- If it is not touched (accessed/read) for ``max_idle`` seconds
- ``time_to_live`` seconds passed since it is put to Near Cache

The actual expiration is performed when a record is accessed: it is
checked if the record is expired or not. If it is expired, it is evicted
and ``KeyError`` is raised to the caller.

Near Cache Invalidation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Invalidation is the process of removing an entry from the Near Cache
when its value is updated or it is removed from the original map (to
prevent stale reads). See the `Near Cache Invalidation
section <https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/#near-cache-invalidation>`__
in the Hazelcast IMDG Reference Manual.

Monitoring and Logging
----------------------

Enabling Client Statistics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can monitor your clients using Hazelcast Management Center.

As a prerequisite, you need to enable the client statistics before
starting your clients. There are two arguments of ``HazelcastClient``
related to client statistics:

- ``statistics_enabled``: If set to ``True``, it enables collecting the
  client statistics and sending them to the cluster. When it is
  ``True`` you can monitor the clients that are connected to your
  Hazelcast cluster, using Hazelcast Management Center. Its default
  value is ``False``.

- ``statistics_period``: Period in seconds the client statistics are
  collected and sent to the cluster. Its default value is ``3``.

You can enable client statistics and set a non-default period in seconds
as follows:

.. code:: python

    client = hazelcast.HazelcastClient(
        statistics_enabled=True,
        statistics_period=4
    )

Hazelcast Python client can collect statistics related to the client and
Near Caches without an extra dependency. However, to get the statistics
about the runtime and operating system,
`psutil <https://pypi.org/project/psutil/>`__ is used as an extra
dependency.

If the ``psutil`` is installed, runtime and operating system statistics
will be sent to cluster along with statistics related to the client and
Near Caches. If not, only the client and Near Cache statistics will be
sent.

``psutil`` can be installed independently or with the Hazelcast Python
client as follows:

**From PyPI**

::

    pip install hazelcast-python-client[stats]

**From source**

::

    pip install -e .[stats]

After enabling the client statistics, you can monitor your clients using
Hazelcast Management Center. Please refer to the `Monitoring Clients
section <https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/management-center/latest/manual/html/index.html#monitoring-clients>`__
in the Hazelcast Management Center Reference Manual for more information
on the client statistics.

.. Note:: Statistics sent by Hazelcast Python client 4.0 are compatible
    with Management Center 4.0. Management Center 4.2020.08 and newer
    versions will be supported in version 4.1 of the client.

Logging Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hazelcast Python client uses Python’s builtin ``logging`` package to
perform logging.

All the loggers used throughout the client are identified by their
module names. Hence, one may configure the ``hazelcast`` parent logger
and use the same configuration for the child loggers such as
``hazelcast.lifecycle`` without an extra effort.

Below is an example of the logging configuration with ``INFO`` log level
and a ``StreamHandler`` with a custom format, and its output.

.. code:: python

    import logging
    import hazelcast

    logger = logging.getLogger("hazelcast")
    logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)

    handler = logging.StreamHandler()
    formatter = logging.Formatter("%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s")
    handler.setFormatter(formatter)
    logger.addHandler(handler)

    client = hazelcast.HazelcastClient()

    client.shutdown()

**Output**

A handy alternative to above example would be configuring the root
logger using the ``logging.basicConfig()`` utility method. Beware that,
every logger is the child of the root logger in Python. Hence,
configuring the root logger may have application level impact.
Nonetheless, it is useful for the testing or development purposes.

.. code:: python

    import logging
    import hazelcast

    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

    client = hazelcast.HazelcastClient()

    client.shutdown()

To learn more about the ``logging`` package and its capabilities, please
see the `logging
cookbook <https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging-cookbook.html>`__ and
`documentation <https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html>`__ of
the ``logging`` package.

Defining Client Labels
----------------------

Through the client labels, you can assign special roles for your clients
and use these roles to perform some actions specific to those client
connections.

You can also group your clients using the client labels. These client
groups can be blacklisted in Hazelcast Management Center so that they
can be prevented from connecting to a cluster. See the `related
section <https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/management-center/latest/manual/html/index.html#changing-cluster-client-filtering>`__
in the Hazelcast Management Center Reference Manual for more information
on this topic.

You can define the client labels using the ``labels`` config option. See
the below example.

.. code:: python

    client = hazelcast.HazelcastClient(
        labels=[
            "role admin",
            "region foo"
        ]
    )

Defining Client Name
--------------------

Each client has a name associated with it. By default, it is set to
``hz.client_${CLIENT_ID}``. Here ``CLIENT_ID`` starts from ``0`` and it
is incremented by ``1`` for each new client. This id is incremented and
set by the client, so it may not be unique between different clients
used by different applications.

You can set the client name using the ``client_name`` configuration
element.

.. code:: python

    client = hazelcast.HazelcastClient(
        client_name="blue_client_0"
    )

Configuring Load Balancer
-------------------------

Load Balancer configuration allows you to specify which cluster member
to send next operation when queried.

If it is a :ref:`using_python_client_with_hazelcast_imdg:smart client`,
only the operations that are not key-based are routed to the member
that is returned by the ``LoadBalancer``. If it is not a smart client,
``LoadBalancer`` is ignored.

By default, client uses round robin load balancer which picks each
cluster member in turn. Also, the client provides random load balancer
which picks the next member randomly as the name suggests. You can use
one of them by setting the ``load_balancer`` config option.

The following are example configurations.

.. code:: python

    from hazelcast.util import RandomLB

    client = hazelcast.HazelcastClient(
        load_balancer=RandomLB()
    )

You can also provide a custom load balancer implementation to use
different load balancing policies. To do so, you should provide a class
that implements the ``LoadBalancer``\ s interface or extend the
``AbstractLoadBalancer`` class for that purpose and provide the load
balancer object into the ``load_balancer`` config option.
