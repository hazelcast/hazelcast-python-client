class CountDownLatch(BaseCPProxy):
    """A distributed, concurrent countdown latch data structure.

    CountDownLatch is a cluster-wide synchronization aid
    that allows one or more callers to wait until a set of operations being
    performed in other callers completes.

    CountDownLatch count can be reset using ``try_set_count()`` method after
    a countdown has finished but not during an active count. This allows
    the same latch instance to be reused.

    There is no ``await_latch()`` method to do an unbound wait since this is undesirable
    in a distributed application: for example, a cluster can split or the master
    and replicas could all die. In most cases, it is best to configure
    an explicit timeout so you have the ability to deal with these situations.

    All of the API methods in the CountDownLatch offer the exactly-once
    execution semantics. For instance, even if a ``count_down()`` call is
    internally retried because of crashed Hazelcast member, the counter
    value is decremented only once.

        """Causes the current thread to wait until the latch has counted down to
        zero, or an exception is thrown, or the specified waiting time elapses.

        If the current count is zero then this method returns ``True``.

        If the current count is greater than zero, then the current
        thread becomes disabled for thread scheduling purposes and lies
        dormant until one of the following things happen:

        - The count reaches zero due to invocations of the ``count_down()`` method
        - This CountDownLatch instance is destroyed
        - The countdown owner becomes disconnected
        - The specified waiting time elapses

        If the count reaches zero, then the method returns with the
        value ``True``.

        If the specified waiting time elapses then the value ``False``
        is returned.  If the time is less than or equal to zero, the method
