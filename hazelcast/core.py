    HazelcastJsonValue is a wrapper for JSON formatted strings. It is preferred

    HazelcastJsonValue is queried using Hazelcast's querying language.
    See `Distributed Query section <https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-python-client#77-distributed-query>`_.

    In terms of querying, numbers in JSON strings are treated as either
    Long or Double in the Java side. str, bool and None
    are treated as String, boolean and null respectively.

    HazelcastJsonValue keeps given string as it is. Strings are not
    checked for being valid. Ill-formatted JSON strings may cause false
    positive or false negative results in queries.

    HazelcastJsonValue can also be constructed from JSON serializable objects.
    In that case, objects are converted to JSON strings and stored as such.
    If an error occurs during the conversion, it is raised directly.

    None values are not allowed.
