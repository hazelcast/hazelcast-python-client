    "# Hazelcast Python Client SQL Support with Hazelcast Viridian\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the SQL support of Hazelcast Python Client. Hazelcast provides in-depth SQL support for Map data structures kept in Hazelcast Clusters. Using Hazelcast SQL, you can create mappings between your data and a Map and then execute SQL queries against the Map. This support provides fast in-memory computing using SQL engine without writing complex functions that iterate through your maps.\n",
    "You can learn more about SQL Engine from our HazelVision episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXWwNCZxLrs</br></br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this tutorial, you can either connect to your local cluster or Hazelcast Viridian. If you want to connect your local cluster, remove the config options inside `hazelcast.HazelcastClient()` call. Hazelcast Viridian offers free registration with a 2GB storage area. You can register using the following link and create a cluster in a few minutes: https://viridian.hazelcast.com/.</br></br>\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to run this notebook on Jupyter locally, you can download the notebook file from our GitHub repo: https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-python-client/tree/master/examples/jupyter-notebooks </br></br> If you have any issues, you can ask your questions in Hazelcast Community channels, find links here: https://hazelcast.com/dev-community/ also feel free to reach out at developer-relations@hazelcast.com"

    "In this first query, we will use essential features of SQL, like the `WHERE` clause. We have some filters to select movies among 4K entries, like `vote_count`, `vote_average`, and `release_date`. You can use `AS` keyword to specify the column name of result. Without Hazelcast, typically, we need to iterate over our map and check whether the current entry fits into our definition or not. Also, this approach requires an additional structure to store our selected entries. With the inclusive SQL support of Hazelcast, we can translate our filters to a SQL query and execute it on our map.
