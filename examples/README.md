 Hazelcast Python Client Code Examples Readme
=============================

This folder contains a collection of code samples which you can use to learn how to use Hazelcast features.

How to try these examples
-------------------------

* To try these examples, you should have a running Hazelcast member. If you are already familiar with Hazelcast and have a member running, add its address and port to your configuration as shown in the [**/learning-basics/1-configure_client.py**](learning-basics/1-configure_client.py).
* If not, follow the steps described in the [Working with Hazelcast IMDG Clusters section](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-python-client/blob/master/README.md#12-working-with-hazelcast-imdg-clusters) of the README and start a Hazelcast member in your local computer.
