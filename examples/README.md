Hazelcast Python Client Code Examples Readme
============================================

This folder contains a collection of code samples which you can 
use to learn how to use Hazelcast features.

How to try these examples
-------------------------

* To try these examples, you should have a running Hazelcast member. 
  If you are already familiar with Hazelcast and have a member running, 
  add its address and port to your configuration as shown in the 
  [**/learning-basics/1-configure_client.py**](learning-basics/1-configure_client.py).
* If not, you can use our official Docker images to start a member.

    ```bash
    docker run -p 5701:5701 hazelcast/hazelcast:5.1
    ```
  To see the other ways to start Hazelcast members, see 
  [Working with Hazelcast Clusters](https://hazelcast.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started.html#working-with-hazelcast-clusters)
  section of our documentation.
